Sling Dispatcher Servlet Framework

This framework allows integration CQ5/Sling with Spring Framework. It's based on the concept of sling custom servlet.

Once added to any Sling/CQ5 project - it gives developers flexibility to work in pure MVC manner without doing the java coding within jsp files (way recommended by Adobe).

More details to be added soon.
